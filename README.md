# Horseman Game
Just a little fun project written in [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

# Game control
 - To jump - press SPACE
 - To retry - press "retry" button in the top-left corner
 - That's it!

# Source code
I don't know why this piece of sh*t doesn't work outside p5 web editor. That's why my "index.html" file has only this line of code:

---
    <iframe style="width: 800px; height: 450px;" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Chingiz/embed/by21ll8n"></iframe>
